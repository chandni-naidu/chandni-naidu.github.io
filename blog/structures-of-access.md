# Structures of Access

Accessibility and Inclusive Design: Day 1

**Intentions**

In this year’s course on accessibility and inclusive design, I wanted to pay close attention to 2 things:

1. The language of access and barriers, instead of the language of disability and personal limitations
2. Intersectional discourse on the subject of accessibility, including social factors

To elaborate on the first, the lecture and exercises on the first day were an exploration of resources and barriers. After an introduction to the course outline and goals, we went straight into the resource mapping exercise.

**Exercise 1: Resource Mapping**

We listed all the possible types of resources, systems, products, services and organisations that human beings could aspire to access. We categorised them as physical, social, educational, professional and healthcare.

Saving this mapping for later when we discuss limitations in access for people with different disabilities and social factors.

**Regulations of access to resources**

Nearly all human-made and natural resources have regulated or restriced access. There are often rigid rules about who can access how much of the world and all the parts of it. The rules may not always be clear, transparent or obvious. They may not always be intentionally developed, but these structures of barriers exist almost everywhere.

**Nature of barriers**

1.  Unintentional barriers\
    When certain types of people, despite being the intended users of a resource, are unable to access the resource for optimum utilisation.

    Unintentional barriers could be due to:

    1. Resource constraints
    2. Lack of intention
    3. Ineffective design
2.  Intentional barriers

    There are several intentional barriers we set up in society to limit access. Some of the reasons could be

    1. limited resources
    2. law-and-order, limiting crime
    3. discriminatory, to protect interest of certain groups over that of others

**Types of barriers**

1.  Physical

    When physical access to spaces are limited to people with mobility issues, or when access is deliberately restricted based on other dimensions.
2.  Economic

    Many organizations, services, products are only accessible to people who can afford them
3.  Linguistic

    Entire economies, communities and systems of knowledge are only accessible if one is fluent/conversant in a specific language
4.  Sensory

    People with sensory disabilities such as blindness or deafness will find many resources inaccessible to them
5.  Cognitive

    People with cognitive disabilities and disorders will find challenges in access to parts of society
6.  Social

    We discriminate based on gender, appearance, ethnicity, race, caste, religion and more dimensions of differences that come with a set of prejudices and biases
7.  Information

    When information is unavailable or hard to come by, it can act as a barrier in itself.

We also spoke about degrees of access and inclusion. With the example of the university campus, we placed these types of access on a sliding scale.

**Degrees of Access**

1.  Exclusion

    Not having access to a resource due to one or more of the barriers discussed above
2.  Physical access

    Access to a space is one dimension, but it does not always mean that one has access to the key resources that the space has to offer. For example, the cleaning staff at a university campus, despite being fairly capable of pursuing higher education with some support, are not even considered part of the learning system.
3.  Full intended access

    The status of being a student for example, gives one access to all the learning resources available on campus. There might be a few restricted labs, but largely, the space does not have any barriers, assuming one is able-bodied
4.  Inclusion

    Simply being an enrolled student may not make one feel included in the social fabric of the space unless they take the effort to socialize, or some structured socialising is enabled by the administration. Personal attention, guidance counseling, good relationships with peers and faculty, all go a long way in making a student feel included. This is a necessary aspect of enabling students to do their best and grow.
5.  Ownership

    In capitalist societies, individuals and groups enjoy a special type of access called ownership. Under this, they have staked their rights to control resources and do what they like with it, subject to local and national laws.

In tomorrow’s lesson, we will be going into more details of mobility barriers for different human needs.

***

In keeping with the intent (mentioned in the beginning of this article) we will discuss diverse human needs as objectively as possible in relation to access to resources. We will refrain from talking about disabilities as shortcomings, or individual failings in any form. Instead of talking about disability-X needing accomodation-Y, we want to speak of resource-Z being accessible to all intended users, and how the range of intended users can be made more diverse with intentionally accessible design. I might come back and draw this up in a relational diagram to emphasise the importance of this narrative shift.

# Foundations in Design

What it's like being an intern in an architecture studio founded by over-achieving celebrity architects, and junior architects who worship at the altar of perfection with sweat, blood and tears.

I was nineteen, having successfully endured three years of "education" in basic drawing, complex drawing, still life drawing, painting, furniture design, history of art and architecture, construction techniques, materials, ergonomics, structural design, concrete admixes, flying buttresses and balustrades and waffle slabs, I found myself at a small, elite architecture studio, signing up to do whatever work the architects couldn't do themselves.

My first task was to draw the railing details for the stairwell of a luxurious high-rise apartment complex. Construction was on at the 8th floor, and the staff on site needed instructions to execute. How thrilling. The drawing I made would get built the very next day. Too much power.

I wasn't designing anything, at least not the way one would normally think of design. All I had to do was Specify exactly where the railing should go on each tread. Why couldn't I just tell the construction supervisor - "put each railing in the middle of the tread"? Simple, logical.

No, if the flight of stairs had 10 steps, I had to plan what it would look like if we put railings on every step, on every alternate step, or two per step. How would this look from the lobby, how would it look from the pool, and from the sidewalk on the street outside? Also, how close do they need to be so "a child doesn't slip through" The building codes permit a maximum of 100mm. A tread is typically 250-300mm. It's been ten years since this drawing, and I remember these details. I'm not very sure why.

It wasn't enough that the construction turned out right, it was also very important to the studio that every working drawing that went out with the name "Hundredhands" was of the very best, irrefutably high quality.

This is the glorious building I cut my teeth on. The studio must have made thousands of drawings, plans and details to design this building. I worked on a couple hundred perhaps.

The next task I was given was to do the bathroom tiling layout.

Until this point, I did not know such a thing was required to lay tiles on a bathroom. Ever noticed oddly cut tiles like this? This would just not do in a "luxury" apartment. It had to be perfectly resolved with clever math, planning and precision. The kind you couldn't trust a mason with.

And to get this drawing right, I had to do it over 6 times. It wasn't because of the tiles, I got that right the first time. But my drawings were a nightmare. If I could go into the server archives of Hundredhands and look for drawings made in June 2010, I'd be very embarrassed, but also it would be good to see what I did not know.

I used curves to draw arrows for annotation.

I didn't align dimensions.

I annotated every detail and cluttered the drawing, with no thought as to what information was essential, and what could be deduced.

I used the same line weight for all drawings. On print, it looked like garbage. I learnt what difference every point made in the clarity and readability of construction drawings.

Every time I made an A2 sized print out of my "final drawing", Harish (the architect I was assigned to) would pull up a pencil and go circling and crossing and slashing all over my drawing and I'd go back to fix everything, get a new print out, rinse repeat. Six times, to get my first drawing out the door. For a tiling layout.

How absolutely lucky I was.

I went on to work on sections of interior design details, complete drawing packs for the hotel rooms, and even wayfinding signages. Six months of details, prints and reprints.

Every time there was a "design" change, it was down to the interns to make sure that all the details were updated, and there were no uncaught, unresolved, jagged corners or unsavoury edges. And they used to make me angry! I was furious that the principal designers did not think this through _before_ I made all the minutest joinery details. I was annoyed that there would be room for change at all. Why entertain changes that meant more work. I did not know the word iterative design then, all I was concerned is about was reducing the number of large sized prints I was wasting with every mistake or change.

And why was it so important that everything lined up anyway. What's wrong with unresolved corners, so what if the windows don't line up from the outside, so what if the railings are all differently spaced on each floor? Is that what design is? To just tidy and line everything up?

A young, naive, impatient me had some time to ponder these questions and debate them with Bijoy, who had the patience to engage, and encouraged even the silliest of lines of thought.

No, getting things to line up was not all design was about. It was about thoughtfulness, being thorough, planning for the precise intended effect, not leaving the output to chance. It was about control, it was about directing the process of creation so we know what to expect. In construction, you can't tear down things you build if they turned out wrong. Despite the cost, we sometimes did.

Design was the ability to articulate intention, balance that with what's possible, visualise a possible outcome, engage and debate and iterate before execution, and then translate it through to output, whatever the means and material. And the discourse never stops. Everything built is critiqued, discussed, presented in gatherings, everybody learns, everybody contributes and takes from the collective knowledge we build, called the practice of architecture.

Now I work with pixels. They are so much easier than wood, stone and concrete. Pixels can be updated every minute.

Also, I don't just work with pixels, I build systems, patterns of interaction, I deal with cognition. It's that much more exciting because everything is alive and dynamic, we can learn from observation and inquiry, we can iterate on the same product and keep making it better and hopefully course correct if we make it worse.

I can't go back to being an architect, but the lessons from the practice are the solid foundations I stand on, as a digital experience designer.

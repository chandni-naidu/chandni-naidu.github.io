* As an interaction designer, I've built and shipped high-impact physical and digital products.
* Founded an inclusive education startup, partnered with schools in urban and rural India, worked with children with a range of disabilities. Keenly interested in education, health, gender equality and development.
* Worked at a neo-bank for small businesses, transforming the way entrepreneurs handle business finances.
* Now building my art studio in between teaching gigs, and developing my research proposal.

About a decade back, I studied architecture. I enjoyed studying heritage conservation and urban design. Later, I worked with a luxury brand designing jewelry stores that reflect the regional craft heritage and unique wedding traditions. I was traveling extensively and discovering my country on the job.&#x20;

In 2014, when the first smartwatches became available, I started to pay closer attention to the design of computing interfaces. I suppose I'd taken phones and laptops quite for granted until then, never looking past their utility in my life as an architect.&#x20;

> When I discovered ✨**human computer interaction design,**✨ I knew I'd come home.

I went on to earn a masters in HCI (IxD) at IIT Bombay (2015-17), where I had the chance to indulge the restless tinkerer, the intuitive problem solver, and the curious collaborator in me. I got to explore virtual and mixed reality, embodied and gesture interactions, and generally some very cool technical HCI. Two courses that had an huge impact on me:&#x20;

* &#x20;Game Design
* &#x20;Instructional Design

These two domains of knowledge have shaped my approach to ed-tech: learning through play.&#x20;

While in the final semester of my masters, juggled a design thesis with company-founding to commercially launch a product I'd been prototyping at IDC- it was effectively me and a wooden contraption powered by Processing (P5), with promise of future potential to dazzle. With some seed funding from a campus incubator, I was able to find a product-market fit, build a team, and establish steady revenue streams. Thus began [Tactopus](https://tactopus.com/), a small ed-tech startup with big goals- to create accessible and inclusive learning aids for children with vision impairment. We are (as of Dec '19) a team of 10, funded by Social Alpha and IDFC FIRST Bank, and our products are in 300+ schools, libraries, resource centres and homes - helping children learn through multi-sensory play. I led the team till Jan 2020, and the company was acquired by KinderPass in June 2022.

Since then, I've worked as a product designer, researcher and design manager in product teams across the world. Taking up the occasional teaching gig keeps me close to the fundamentals of design that help explore more novel ideas. If you know of a product team working on challenging problems, that might be in need of an enthusiastic, curious, go-getter of a designer, please get in touch :)

I'm currently leaning into the design of spatial interfaces that will have a crucial role in the building of a ubiquitously smart world, where using “tech” does not necessarily mean having your eyes glued to a screen. Multi-modal and embodied interactions are an inherent and automatic part of spatial computing, with exciting opportunities.

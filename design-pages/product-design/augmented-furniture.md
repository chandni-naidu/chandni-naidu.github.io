#### Background

FeelXR is a startup based in Canada, working on bringing the power of Augmented Reality to large office furniture manufacturers. The product enables furniture companies to make their furniture offerings viewable with AR by just adding a line of code to their own product pages.

#### Product Design Brief

The beachhead market for this product is going to be office furniture manufacturers, whose primary clients are office space developers. The idea is to create a product that the marketing teams can use to enhance the product's webpages and make it a more compelling sales experience for clients.

Platform users - marketing team of furniture manufacturers

AR users - office space developers who make bulk furniture purchases, key decision makers being architects and interior design professionals.

Objectives:

* enhance the sales process with augmented reality
* enable better visualisation and decision making by office space developers
* to reduce the need for physical samples to be sent to clients (saving significant costs)

# Founding of Tactopus: Inclusive, Multi-sensory Learning

#### Intent

Started the company with a mission to address the lack of access to learning material for children with disabilities. Thanks to the support of many individuals and organisations, we were able to develop, manufacture and ship products serving schools, resource centres, parents and children with disabilities all over the world.

#### My Role

The time I spend building this organisation has been very rewarding. I had the opportunity to engage with a range of stakeholders, from children with and without disabilities, parents, teachers, school decision makers, retailers and distributors, special educators, government bodies, non-governmental organisations, accelerators and incubators, mentors, investors, impact evangelists, and many fellow entrepreneurs.

Since November 2019, I play an advisory role, and Tactopus has pivoted from producing physical products to being an online education service matching special educators with children who need therapy and rehabilitation due to their disabilities.

#### Products

I feel like I could write a whole thesis about the development, testing, research and evolution of each of these products. Don't all founders?

#### Full Product List

Apart from interactive and digitally enhanced experiences, the community also expressed demand or other tactile playables and learning material. This is the range of physical products we produced and shipped as individual products as well as kits for schools.

# The Tactopus Phone Stand

#### Phone Stand

The phone stand or holder in its current version looks extremely simple and has been proven to be easy to use. We've been able to produce it in the right material(s) and is lat-packed by design to make it easy to ship, carry around, or store away when not in use.

As with many simple things, it did not happen overnight, and considerable thought, iterations and collaborative work has gone into making this possible. This is why the stand gets a page of its own :)

#### Key Funtion

Whether we were working with a webcam or a phone camera, the primary function of the stand is to hold the device at the right angle to enable maximum and clear coverage of the play space.

#### Design Process

Design, test, iterate, rinse repeat, but stop somewhere, we have to ship!

While the essential funciton has remained the same, the technology and context (webcam to hone cam, position detection to marker detection, AR markers to QR code markers) have changed over the course of product development and the stand design has had to be constantly reinvented until it worked.

I had to learn to work a laser cutting machine (a much cherished skill) and some basics of industrial design from collaborators in order to respond to this design challenge.

Moving completely to a mobile based experience with some trade-offs that affected the nature of experiences we could design going forward.

The four piece construction, a significant breakthrough which would make design and handling much easier.

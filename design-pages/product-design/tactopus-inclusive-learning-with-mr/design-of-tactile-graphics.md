# Design of Tactile Graphics

### Tactile Information Design

#### **Internship at Xaviers' Resource Centre for the Visually Challenged, Mumbai**

This was a month-long summer internship at XRCVC, and my brief was to set up their new thermoforming machine, source material for use, and provide an instruction set for the staff to continue to use the machine for prototyping.

A thermoforming machine uses heat and vaccum to replicte the form of a hard mould, onto a sheet of plastic. This plastic sheet with tactile information is used by people with vision impairment to access imagery that is otherwise inaccessible in print format.Here are some explorations to understand the medium and material.

In order to test this process, I had to create some moulds. The kind of heat-resistant material I needed for 3D printing wasn't immediately available then, so I started the process with manually created moulds.

I used Open Topography data to create 3D models of the terrain at micro level - few square kilometres, as well as regions the size of cities. Larger the area to be represented, the flatter the area looks. The features don't stand out as much as one might have imagined. I worked around this with some creative exaggerations for the sake of clarity.

1. that a lot of visual design principles do not translate well to a tactile medium, but
2. information design for easy cognitive consumption is still effectively the same approach and
3. tactile graphics are slow, difficult to label, difficult to understand, and quite limiting.

I wanted to continue exploring how these tangible graphics can be augmented with audio labels and other interactions. Which directly led to my work in Project II, and became the groundwork for [interactive-tactile-graphics-masters-thesis.md](interactive-tactile-graphics-masters-thesis.md "mention") focusing on ed-tech products that are inclusive and accessible to people with disabilities.

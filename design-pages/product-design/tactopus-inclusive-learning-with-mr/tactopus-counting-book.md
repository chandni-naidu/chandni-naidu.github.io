# Tactopus Counting Book

#### Intent

When we developed the interactive book format for What Makes You Special, there was a similar need for help with math, and the counting book was conceptualised as a primer for blind children to numbers and their braille representation, with more focus on getting a sense of quantities in a tangible way.

#### Early Explorations

The need for accessible learning material in math cannot be emphasised enough for people with vision loss. Addressing this need has been part of the work from the earliest work at Tactopus.

Vertical iteration where the tactile parts of the card (tend to be covered by the hand) are separated from the AR marker so it stays visible and fast to detect.

Despite the efforts to achieve fast detection using Vuforia and Unity in an AR framework, we still had a significant failure rate, and in the case of children with vision loss, it caused a lot of confusion as they'd ever know if they did something wrong, or if the app was just not doing its job. We then switched to a QR code based identification using a simpler framework.

We also produced alphabet cards with the same technique, which would be used with other products.

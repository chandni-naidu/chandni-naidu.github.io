I lead a team of product designers working on bookkeeping (business analytics and accounting integrations.) The team's goal is to make it easy for accountants to manage business finances and compliance with ease. Listed below are some of the features/projects I worked on:

### Expense management

* Budgets
* Expense Limits
* Merchant Locks
* Subscription management

When we launched physical cards in 2021 after popular demand, we had design a system of identification for the new tangible cards.

I created an attachment to go with the tangible cards that looks like a card sleeve.&#x20;

The visual design system to clearly distinguish physical cards from virtual ones, even when listed in the same page, or as thumbnails:

### Design Leadership: experience and learning

After a few months as an individual contributor, I was promoted to the role of Design Manager, to lead the bookkeeping design team. Some of the work I oversaw as a manager:

ü¶Ñ **Design Review Process**: As the design team scaled from 6 to 20, I worked with the Design Lead to set up a well defined product design process SoP, **a playbook on how designers and PMs can collaborate effectively and deliver best product quality**. It included a framework of review goals to ensure smooth alignment at every stage.

‚è± **Design Workload Management**: Moved the design team's project management to Jira and helped onboard designers.

üîç **Research Process**: I set up the research process across the product team to ensure PMs and designers can get the best insights and benefit from hypothesis-driven rigour, and form actionable insights for product decision making.

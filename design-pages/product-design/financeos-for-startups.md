### Design Leadership: experience and learning

After a few months as an individual contributor, I was promoted to the role of Design Manager, to lead the bookkeeping design team. Some of the work I oversaw as a manager:

ü¶Ñ **Design Review Process**: As the design team scaled from 6 to 20, I worked with the Design Lead to set up a well defined product design process SoP, **a playbook on how designers and PMs can collaborate effectively and deliver best product quality**. It included a framework of review goals to ensure smooth alignment at every stage.

‚è± **Design Workload Management**: Moved the design team's project management to Jira and helped onboard designers.

üîç **Research Process**: I set up the research process across the product team to ensure PMs and designers can get the best insights and benefit from hypothesis-driven rigour, and form actionable insights for product decision making.

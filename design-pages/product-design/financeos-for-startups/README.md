I lead a team of product designers working on bookkeeping (business analytics and accounting integrations.) The team's goal is to make it easy for accountants to manage business finances and compliance with ease.

### Note on design leadership

ü¶Ñ **Design Review Process**: As the design team scaled from 6 to 20, I worked with the Design Lead to set up a well defined product design process SoP, **a playbook on how designers and PMs can collaborate effectively and deliver best product quality**. It included a framework of review goals to ensure smooth alignment at every stage.

‚è± **Design Workload Management**: Moved the design team's project management to Jira and helped onboard designers.

üîç **Research Process**: I set up the research process across the product team to ensure PMs and designers can get the best insights and benefit from hypothesis-driven rigour, and form actionable insights for product decision making.

#### Usage Data

In the product test we ran, both vertical and horizontal swiping were enabled.

Usage data showed a clear preference for vertical swiping. There could also be an ergonomic factor involved. Left-right swiping is more tedious than vertical, and is easier with a tap-for-next interaction that Instagram stories made popular. This was tested separately in the stories feature introduced in one of the main Popcore games. We saw similar results - users only watched one video of each game. It supports the notion that the game really are very simple to grasp.

This navigation pattern was replaced by a simpler vertical-scroll feed.

In parallel, during the deployment cycle, I interviewed users who played hyper-casual games and often shared screen-recordings on social media. Juxtaposing insights from the interviews with the business goals for this product, I created this spectrum of engagement, for us to be able to profile/locate users. On social media like Instagram and tiktok, hyper-casual games were already being shared in short-video format, but not typically streamed like console/PC games.

At this point, we were also considering if popcore's games could fit into this app or be better as a separate product - PopGames (now names PlayTime). We were waiting for a long-promised Unity feature that allowed for 3D games to be converted to HTML. With Popcore's own games, we could make it possible for users to play sample levels before downloading, with the hope to increase install rates. This product roadmap compares the player experience between the two types of discovery, to enable better decision making.

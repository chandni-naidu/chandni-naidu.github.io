# MVP

The MVP was a video feed with game meta data - Title, hashtags classifying the game experience. With this basic starting point, there were many open-ended questions still.

1. Navigation - This was in March 2020, Tiktok's peak popularity phase. The vertical scroll, full-screen video navigation was an interaction pattern that we could assume was very familiar to our target users.
2. One could "save" games, which is akin to 'liking' but meant to also serve as a curating space. So the saved games had to be organised into lists or collections.
3. Share button - links to a web-app version with minimal features. This was external sharing, but would eventually need within-app sharing as well. And how would we make users find each other if all you have on the feed was a feed of videos created by us? The social-network aspect of the app was yet to be worked on.
4. Hashtags - was this the best way to categorise games? Ideally the tags should be user-generated, but there was no immediate plans to accommodate user-generated content.
5.  User generated content, UGC. That would require hosting, stringent screening, additional legal work that the business was not willing to invest in. The penalty for accidental pornographic/inappropriate content showing up on the app was too high for a European company. Was really interesting to note how the laws of the land dictate what kind of tech can be built, even if the audience is global.

    Going from here, I worked on the wire-frames and user journey to first lay out the app's experience architecture. This was a useful process to highlight unanswered questions and list assumptions.

# Ed-tech: Modern writing tool for language arts classrooms

The relationship between AI and writing (or any creative process) is tricky. This is no reason to shy away from learning to use relevant tools. On the contrary, educators must help learners use tools the right way.

One of the main goals of this app is to build transparency between students and educators in the ways in which AI is used.

The other contribution is to demonstrate that AI can help, but cannot write like you do. A personal voice is important, and we must pay attention to developing it.

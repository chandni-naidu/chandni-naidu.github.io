# â˜€ LiBo: Mirror game to learn light behavior (for Agastya Foundation)

### Residency at Agastya Foundation

A few hours away from the big, noisy city of Bangalore, there's a small village of quiet curiosity, that sometimes gets quite loud with the voices of excited children as they explore life-size models and interactive science experiments. The drab drawings in their textbooks were coming alive and finally making sense in this campus. This is [**Agastya Foundation**](https://www.agastya.org/)'s Kuppam Campus.When I got the opportunity to do a short residency there upon Prof. Alka Hingorani's suggestion, I couldn't have foreseen how the environment would affect my creative process.

I was to spend two weeks here, but in a well-equipped innovation centre, and work on the following brief: To humanise models, to make the experiences more memorable, relatable and easy to use. After much pondering, I realised that the experiences were not quite like creating lesson plans. Designing exhibits at Agastya is a lot like blurb writing, or book-cover design. Picking the best quotes, reviews, and descriptions to put on the cover, to get even a passing reader hooked enough that they go back and read the whole book. The first few days, I spent simply assimilating what Agastya was all about. Then I shortlisted a few topics, and zeroed in on optics. Targeting students of class 6-8, I designed a playful way to experience properties of light, in a tangible, hands on way.&#x20;

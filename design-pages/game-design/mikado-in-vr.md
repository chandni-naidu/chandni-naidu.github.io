In a fun VR twist to this came, I explored a puzzle that one solves by blowing up bendy sticks or pipes that enmesh them.

1. Player starts in the centre of this mesh of colorful, bent, entangled pipes.
2. Looks around to find which pipe is the closest, not cut across by any other pipe.
3. Selects it to burn/burst/disapparate, whatever it is, it will be fun to design. Selcetion may have to be with a click/button as gaze will not be very effective.
4. Once all the pipes are gone, player has freed themselves to progress to the next level.

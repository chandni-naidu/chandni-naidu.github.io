# What Makes You Special?

### Intent

Like a lot of other things about Tactopus, this book was inspired by young blind children. I was at XRCVC one weekend evening when a workshop was going on with children who are visually impaired, who go to mainstream schools. The weekend workshops are designed to help them cope with their peers and provide additional support through tactile material. This evening, the workshop was on animals.

I watched the small room come alive with children being curious about animals that the instructor was describing to them, playing eagerly with toys and 3D models of animals, while their parents (and I ) watched on. There was something so utterly magical about children's fascination with animals.

If you're a person with sight, you probably know this feeling. Animals and stories about animals are incredibly powerful fuel for the imagination with children with vision loss.

This book was designed to be a gateway to the world of animals for all children, and augmented with audio and textured material, it has indeed made many children happy.

### Early Explorations

For children's stories, Pratham's [Storyweaver](https://storyweaver.org.in/) has been a great source of material published under the Creative Commons license.

We at Tactopus wanted to adapt some of those stories into a tactile form, and one of the first stories we worked with was ["It's All The Cat's Fault"](https://storyweaver.org.in/stories/1281-it-s-all-the-cat-s-fault) And not surprisingly, the cat with all the interesting audio effects we added, was an instant success with children. Other characters were relatively harder to make tactile copies of.

### Tactile Illustration

This [story](https://storyweaver.org.in/stories/1928-what-makes-you-special) by Nalini Sorensen was a great fit as it had mentions of many animals and had a positive spin - which we in fact modified to make it inclusive.

Starting as a tactile-first design process, we created the best textures we could for the animals. Like this rubbery bubbled frog skin is not accurate but sparks the imagination of children.

### Visual Design

This book had to be read not only by the sighted and blind, but also by the rather finicky mobile phone camera. The illustrations, choice of colors, style and composition are also influenced on whether it makes an easy-to-identify visual marker for the app to detect instantaneously.

### How it works

Set up: The book is to be placed in a well-lit, comfortable space, and the phone stand set up such that the phone's camera is pointing at the book.

The app: The Tactopus app is set up on the phone, which uses the camera feed to identify the page that's currently open and plays the appropriate sound.

Audio: The sounds include a realistic animal sound, followed by the content of the book. The text is also available in braille on the pages. On the app, a teacher/parent can also change the reading speed that's comfortable for the child

The book: Ten pages plus covers with textured, tactile images. Print illustration is designed to be both visually appealing and work as effective AR markers. We eventually moved away from Vuforia markers to QR codes after a high failure rate.

Flow of audio triggered by the action of turning to a new page:

### Touch and Audio Augmented Reading Experience

By this time the Tactopus phone stand had also evolved considerably to be mobile and easy to use. The app and the book were coming together well to create an immersive experience

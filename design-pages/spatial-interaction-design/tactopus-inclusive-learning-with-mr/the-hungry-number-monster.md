# The Hungry Number Monster

### Intent

Once the basic interactions were refined through the first set of products, we were able to focus on addressing learning needs that were a little more complex. Base don feedback from user testing and from teachers who've been using Tactopus products, we identified that repeated practice was much required. The concept of an endless game was then explored, and culminated in the creation of The Hungry Number Monster.

### Interaction Design

The first two book products were relatively straigh forward interactions, and we wanted to build on that to create more complex interactions to enable complex questions, repetitive learning and add an element of play.

### Early Explorations

The idea was for children to engage with the game, which predominantly manifested as a voice, by responding with tangible elements. As shown in this early test prototype, the slider on the child's right hand side was supposed to toggle between Q and A, for question and answer. SO a child could ask for a question from the system, and then provide a response by putting their responses in the slots provided on the board and then toggle back to Q for the answer to be validated and get the next question.

This prototype was testing with Wizard of Oz method, and we discovered several limitations of the system and also discovered design ideas from observation.

### Flipping the orientation

While it would have been great to continue to use the same phone stand for all products, the complexity of this game required that we work with a sightly different orientation, where the cards are lying flat on the table, undetected unless they're deliberately picked up, and... fed to a monster that's hungry for numbers. Very specific numbers that it loudly asks for, and gets rather impatient about.

In this test, we found the system to work much better, and we had the opportunity to develop and endearing but demanding character for children to play with.

We also tried cards that could be propped up by themselves, but it beat the purpose by making all vertical cards becoming detectable the moment they're in the frame of view of the camera.

We were now able to create interesting question formats such as "how many times did the dog bark?" and play an audio clip of dog barking. In both blind and neuro-divergent students, the use of audio added to the learning experience. In children with autism, there was a marked preference for different types of audio-based questions to practice math skills.

It was much better to have the lay flat while the ones that are actual responses by the child are propped up by being fed into a slot or the mouth of the monster.

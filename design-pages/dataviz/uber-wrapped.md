# ðŸš• Uber Wrapped

To explore more peronal data, I got access to 4 years of my data from Uber to see what I could learn from analysing and visualising it.

My usage before the pandemic was significant. It was my daily commute and often used it while traveling for work outside my home city. After the pandemic set in, and my work turned remote, my uber usage has consequently become rather scanty.

I would not have guessed that my annual expenditure of cab services would amount to \~USD$1500. Feel pretty good about having bought a car now.

# Food Orders, Wrapped

I spent my 2022 between Delhi, India and Nairobi, Kenya.

I was able to compile the data from two service providers of food delivery - Swiggy in India and Glovo in Kenya. Here's a consolidation of my food habit analysis.

In March, I was in Shimla (where there is no swiggy service) and in July, I hadn't yet given in to the local delivery service, Glovo

It was the year I was obsessed with litti choka, a bihari dish baked in earth. And in Nairobi, the top contender was chapati from Java House. Kenyans took the chapati from us and made it so much better, I absolutely prefer it over the indian varieties now.

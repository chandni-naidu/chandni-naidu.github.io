### Abstract

The objective of this project is to present information about the government in such a way that it enables a layperson to understand its complex mechanics and develop informed opinions. In the first phase, the data focused on organisational structure in considerable detail, which did not prove to be useful beyond a browsable directory. In order to truly understand the working of a government, one must be able to trace the flow of decisions and track impact. Here the project pivots from the â€˜what it isâ€™ approach to â€˜what it doesâ€™ though case studies. Focusing on decision making processes, four stories have been selected that each involve the interplay of the legislative, judiciary and executive. These narratives are represented over an illustrated map of New Delhi as short animated clips, which are evaluated over semi-structured interviews with intended users.

### Background

***

The Indian government is one of the largest organisations the world has ever seen, administering a population of 1.2 Billion people, and territory of 3.3 million kmÂ². It is only 60 years old in its current form, and has effected rapid growth and massive transformations over this period. It is an autonomous entity of unprecedented scale and complexity. To have a clear understanding of how this organisational machinery works, one may have to be a constitutional expert, a political scientist, or a tireless reader of long and complex text.

On the other hand, the layperson is, and ought to be, heavily invested in the proceedings of the body that governs them, but face a high jargon barrier. Journalism has traditionally held the duty of deciphering expert-speak into consumable information. However, oversimplifying issues only leads to misinformation and misinterpretation. Set against rapidly diminishing attention spans, it is an increasing challenge to communicate nuances clearly, without losing engagement.

### Design Challenge

***

It is a fairly ambitious project goal, to attempt demystifying government machinery. Even if one were familiar with every law, rule and exception, would one be able to form a clear mental model of how all of its parts work with each other, complete with causal relationships?

### Approach

After a few weeks of explorations using data visualisation tools to indentify potenial areas of focus, I narrowed into one of the topics that seemed to be least understood: the way our laws are made.&#x20;

The definition of a nation is not only its soveriegn territory, but also the rules we agree to function by. The threads of law and legislative processes unite us in a common bond of citizenship.&#x20;

Yet, something so fundamental is discussed very little in education, news and other media.&#x20;



### Design Iterations

To design tools for people to understand our legislative processes better, I collected chronological data on the historical proceedings on two subjects:

1. Changes in animal Rights laws that were protested widely (commonly known as the Jallikattu protests)
2. History of Transgender rights

These two were chosen as their histories are shaped by the involvement of different parts of the government and public opinion.&#x20;



### Interface Design

A desktop interface was designed to help users interact with the history of a bill/law in an interactive space that consisted of:

1. Timline
2. 3D visuals of the adinistrative district in Delhi that covers all important stakeholders (or representatives)
3. Chat interface to explore the storyline&#x20;

The project demonstrates the application of spatially situated storytelling to help follow along the journey of a bill as it gets enacted into law.

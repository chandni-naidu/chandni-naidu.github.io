_Undergraduate and Masters Interaction Design, Interdisciplinary Design_

In this course, we discover ways to expand our definition of users needs beyond the conventional and able-bodied. We learn to look at systems, products and services from a critical view of the barriers they present to people with diverse needs. We shift the dialogue from studying the ‘limitations of human beings with disabilities’ to the ‘limitations of systems in serving intended user groups who may include people with diverse cognitive, sensory, or physical needs.

### [Digital Storytelling for Textile Design](https://www.notion.so/Digital-Storytelling-for-Textile-Design-a8f941b2b8034cada5b3152c32e405ea?pvs=21)

_Undergraduate Textile Design_

Second lock-down in 2021, and the students of textile design are stuck at home, deprived of access to their labs and workshops where the majority of their learning pursuits must take place. What do we do with this situation? Introduce new courses that can be completed virtually. Interaction design? UX design? We took that opportunity and used it to build a storytelling course that helps textile designers communicate the intricacies of their craft to a wider audience using digital prototyping tools.

An introductory HCI course for students of communication design. We started with some programming basics using Processing, learnt about the HCI design process (research to prototyping to testing) and developed interesting products to solve problems faced by students in their new campus.

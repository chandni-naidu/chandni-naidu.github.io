This is a repository of 16 years of work as a **designer, artist, architect, entrepreneur and educator**. As much as I'd love to give you an easy snapshot of my journey, it's important to me that I resist the reductive force of ever-changing industry labels.

To learn more about my relationship to my work, see [about.md](about.md "mention")

This is also an early digital garden, I hope to continue to write about my work here. I've tried blogging, micro-blogging and newsletters, none of those formats help me think and communicate freely. Some types of work must be protected from productisation to have any shot at survival and growth.

Everything here can be chronologically listed under:

* Architecture and urban design: 2007 - 2015
* Interaction, game and spatial design: 2015 - now
* Research: 2016 - now
* Product design: 2020 - now
* Teaching: 2020 - now

Explore projects and notes through the menu on the left (or top-left on mobile devices)&#x20;

Happy browsing!

I do have some favourites to highlight:&#x20;

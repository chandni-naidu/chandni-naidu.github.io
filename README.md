# Home

This is a repository of 16 years of work as a **designer, artist, architect, entrepreneur and educator**. As much as I'd love to give you an easy snapshot of my journey, it's important to me that I resist the reductive force of ever-changing industry labels.

This site is also an early digital garden, I hope to continue to write about my work here. I've tried blogging, micro-blogging and newsletters, none of those formats help me think and communicate freely.&#x20;

To learn more about my relationship to my work, see [about.md](about.md "mention")

Explore projects and notes through the menu on the left (or top-left on mobile devices)&#x20;

Happy browsing!

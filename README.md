This is an archive of over a decade of work as a designer, architect, entrepreneur and educator. It's not meant to be tidy, or even easy to glance through. As much as I'd love to give you a snapshot of my journey, it's important to me that I resist the reductive force of ever-changing industry labels.&#x20;

Happy browsing.

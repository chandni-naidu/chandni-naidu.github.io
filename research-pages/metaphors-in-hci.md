# Metaphors in HCI

### What are metaphors in HCI?

They're nearly everywhere in computers and language associated with computing. Most of their origins can be traced back to western language, lifestyle and culture.&#x20;

Those of us who grew up speaking English or had "developed-country" lifestyles have tremendous advantages over the majority of the world's residents who did not.&#x20;

In this workshop we will explore the origins of metaphors, assess what I'm calling "user-metaphor distance", and learn to develop metaphors that are more relatable to different user groups. Some of these design attempts will lead to highly contextualised metaphors, and some others might lead to more universally understood metaphors. We discuss our findings and observations towards the end of this article.

There were 32 participants, working in groups of 4. After an initialization about metaphors in HCI, we discussed an example of a metaphor and dug into more details:

1. Origins
2. Direct and indirect affordances
3. Related metaphors&#x20;
4. Process of extracting the core function in computing terms, removing as much of the metaphorical references as possible. This step was found to be harder than even the identification of metaphors.&#x20;

### Part 1: Identify

Goal: Identify metaphors and analyse them in the format shared above (image 2)

This analysis was done on A5 sized cards distributed to participants.

Participants were given prints of dashboards, tool sets, and other interface details:&#x20;

1. Browsers - Firefox, Safari, Chrome
2. Graphic editing tools - Photoshop, Illustrator, Procreate
3. Number processing tools - Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers
4. Word processing tools - Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Pages

### Part 2:  Analyse

In the next stage, we&#x20;

* collected the response cards from participants,&#x20;
* screened them for effective analysis and&#x20;
* filtered 32 cards
* redistributed them randomly to the group
* asked the received of the card to further de-abstract the function and describe it in the most primitive, fundamental ways possible

### Part 3: User-group Immersion

Groups were given 1 persona each to study and expand on. The following map was given as an example to start fleshing out the users' world in detail.&#x20;

### Part 4: Reconstruct relevant metaphors

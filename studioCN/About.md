Designer, artist, animal-lover, adventure-seeking solo-traveler. My 2022 was split between Delhi, Shimla, Nairobi and Chennai, as I got comfortable working remotely and exploring different cities as a by-product.

As an interaction designer,

- I've built and shipped several physical and digital products.
    
- Founded a social-impact education startup, partnered with schools in urban and rural India, worked with children with a range of disabilities. Keenly interested in education, health, gender equality and development.
    
- Now working with a neobank for small businesses, transforming the way entrepreneurs handle business finances.

About a decade back, I studied architecture. I was interested in heritage conservation and urban design. Then I designed retail stores for a jewellery brand for a few years.

When I discovered ✨**human computer interaction design,**✨ ****I knew I'd come home.

I went on to do my masters in HCI at IIT Bombay (2015-17), where I had the chance to indulge the restless tinkerer, the intuitive problem solver, and the curious collaborator in me. I got to explore virtual and mixed reality, embodied and gesture interactions, and generally some very cool technical HCI. Two courses that had an impact on me were a) Game Design and b) Instructional Design.

While in the final semester of my masters, juggled a design thesis with company-founding for commercially launching a product I'd been prototyping at IDC- it was effectively me and a wooden contraption powered by Processing (P5), with promise of future potential to dazzle. With support, recognition and funding, I was able to find a product-market fit, build a team, and establish steady revenue streams. Thus began [Tactopus](https://tactopus.com/), a small ed-tech startup with big goals- to create accessible and inclusive learning aids for children with vision impairment. We are (as of Dec '19) a team of 10, funded by Social Alpha and IDFC FIRST Bank, and our products are in 300+ schools, libraries, resource centres and homes - helping children learn through multi-sensory play. I led the team till Jan 2020, and my co-founders continue to actively develop innovative products, working closely with educators and beneficiaries, redefining what learning can be for children with disabilities.

Since then, I've worked as a product designer at a mobile game startup in Berlin, and then as a researcher for a financial inclusion product launched in Indonesia.

~~I currently live in Berlin.~~
~~I’ve moved to Gurgaon, India.~~
I’m working remotely, living in Kenya, and open to relocating to any green, happy city.

I'm learning more about my abilities, interests, and things that excite me to do my best, inspired work. I'm interested in making it simple and easy to access information that could otherwise feel like high cognitive load. If you know of a product team working on challenging problems, that might be in need of an enthusiastic, curious, go-getter of a designer, please get in touch :)

I believe that spatial interfaces have a huge role to play in helping us move to a more ubiquitously smart world, where using “tech” does not necessarily mean having your eyes glued to a screen. Sound, voice, gestures, embodied interactions are all part of what I refer to as spatial interaction- the space I would like to develop more expertise in.
